  <h1>Reflecting on my blogging experience</h1>
  <h4>7/24/15</h4>

  <p>
    Initially writing the blog posts was the only challenge that I really dredded each week in phase 0 of DBC.  When I would tell my cohort mates that I did not enjoy writing the blog posts they were very confused as to why because it was one of their favorite and most rewarding tasks.  I started to think more about why I didn't enjoy writing the blog posts and I came the conclusion that my education had scared me so much that I didn't want to write at all.  My entire life I have struggled with ADHD and dyslexia.  The area that is most affected by these learning disabilities is my writing.  The whole process of writing never really clicked for me.  I could string together solutions to very complex math problems in my head with ease but strings of written words were always a big obstacle in my education. In each and every school I'd go to, teachers would make me feel terrible about myself because my writing was not up to par with the other students.  This isn't to say I was a bad student, I just really struggled with grammar, spelling, and writing.
  </p>
  <p>
    As phase-0 progressed, I found myself enjoying the blog posts more and more.  I realized that people bootcamp weren't going to judge me and didn't any intention of putting me down because my writing didn't flow as well as theirs did.  As I started to internalize this, I became more comfortable tweeting out my links to my blog and sharing my writing with my peers.
  </p>
  <h4>Technical Blog Posts vs Cultural Blog Posts</h4>
  <p>I feel like I am in the minority here, but I significantly preferred the technical blog posts to the cultural blog posts.  I thought the process of attempting to write an article to teach someone about a topic that I enjoyed learning about was very rewarding and beneficial to me.  Throughout my academic career, my friends and I found that the best way to learn something is to teach it.  For example, before each major test in QFIN me and 3 of my closest friends would all get together and attempt to teach the others the chapter we were the worst at.  If you are able to teach someone about a subject then you are approaching mastery in that subject.</p>
  <p>I am not dismissing the cultural challenges and blog posts in any way.  I really enjoyed reading the articles on hand and really forming an opinion about them, but I didn't enjoy actually writing the posts.  Looking back I should've taken advantage of doing a video or audio version of the blog post, but maybe thats soon to come.</p>
