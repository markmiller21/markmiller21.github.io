  <h1>Reviewing my DBC feedback thus far</h1>
  <h4>6/21/15</h4>

  <section>
    <h2> Pairing </h2>
    <h4>What is it like to pair with other to solve challenges?</h4>
    <p>
      One of the reasons why I chose DBC over other programming bootcamps is because they took a holistic approach to learning, spending time developing each person not only as a coder but as a individual as well.  Despite the onsite program not starting yet, this approach shows throughout the pairing sessions. I have never worked with such thoughtful, bright, and polite people in my life.  The people at DBC have made the pairing session very enjoyable.
    </p>
    <p>
      One reason why I prefer the pairing sessions to working by myself, is because I have someone to bounce all my ideas off of before I implement them.  Sometimes my ideas are spot on, and work without changes needed, but sometimes my creativity gets the best of me and a fabricate something that simply won't work, no matter how much time I put in.  In these cases, my partner politely steers me in the right direction
    </p>
    <h2> Feedback </h2>
    <h4>Was the feedback you recieved helpful to your learning?</h4>
    <p>
      When I first looked at my feedback I was ecstatic at how well I was doing, but then I got dissappointed because I realized that I didn't get a lot of valuable feedback.  I was hoping that my partners would give me more critical feedback so I could work on the areas where I a weak to help make me a better coder and partner.  The feedback that I have been giving is very specfic so that my partner can push themselves more and get better.  The feedback that I have been recieving, despite being very positive in terms of performance, have been vague without direction to improve on.  I hope this changes as time goes on because I improve and I know there are things that I could be doing significantly better than I am currently.  Hopefully as we get more comfortable with one-another we give each other more critical feedback so that we can improve upon our craft.
