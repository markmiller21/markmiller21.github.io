    <h4>Concrete Random</h4>
    <p>
      After taking the Anthony Gregorc learning styles quiz, I found that the learning style that fits me best is Concrete Random.  My girlfriend and I were comically laughing about how accurate the description of a concrete random learner was to me.  I always enjoy experimenting to find answers to things and rarely mind taking risks.  The things that are most difficult to me are tasks that have not proven its worth to me.

      Despite concrete random learning styles not well suited for traditional academics, I think that they will excel at DBC because we are curious and won't be bouged down with tedious unnecessary tasks that I did not find helpful in college.  Researching the concrete random learning style got me even more excited to start the on-site portion of DBC.  I will strive to work as much with abstract random thinkers as I can.  I think our combined skill sets will prove to be very beneficial to both parties.

    <h4>
      Growth Mind Sets
    </h4>
    <p>
      Not to be biased, but I belive that most concrete random learners are typically have a more growth oriented mind-set than those of sequential learners.  I am excited to be challenged everyday and push coding abilities to the limit.  One thing I do need to improve is my ability to accept and embrace criticism.  In the past, if criticism was too harsh (or maybe too blunt) I would shutdown and discredit those giving me the harsh feedback.  I think this will be easier than it has in the past for me because of the type of people who attend DBC.
