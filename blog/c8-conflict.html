  <h1>Addressing Conflicts</h1>
  <h4>7/20/15</h4>

  <p> Discuss a time you had a conflict. What was it about? What happened?</p>
  <p class ="answers">
    A few weeks ago I was visiting my brother in Baltimore.  I hadn't seen him in a couple of months so it was great to spend a lot of quality time with him.  As I'm sure many all of you know, there were massive riots in Baltimore this past year.  Well, this visit happened to be a week after the these riots.  While we were walking on the peir, my cousin got a notification of a quadruple homicide less than a mile from where we were.  Granted we were in a very safe place, I did not want to be stuck in Baltimore if these events happened to escalate to something more dangerous and serious.  For this reason, I asked my brother if we could go.  He reluctantly obliged.  We walked the mile and a half back to my car, but my brother was continuing to stop to show us places in Baltimore.  Normally I would be happy to entertain him and check out these places, but I told him that I didn't feel safe and just wanted to leave.  Once we got to the car, he asked if he could drive home because he knew the area better.  On the way back home, he took a number of detours to show us different placees around the city.  At this point I started to shut-down and simply didn't say anything for the rest of the ride back to his place.  Once he got out of the car I raced out of the city and immediately felt better.  However, he felt very hurt by this and sent me some rather mean text-messages about how my actions were rude and innappropriate.
  </p>
  <p>What was the source of the conflict?</p>
  <p class ="answers">
    The source of the conflict was that I really wanted to get out of area that I didn't feel safe in, while my brother wanted me to stay and experience his current city with him
  </p>
  <p>What basic emotions did you feel upon analyzing the conflict?</p>
  <p class ="answers">
    The reason why this situation was so bothering to me was because I felt my safety and independence were being taken away from me.  I value my safety and the ability to in charge of myself over anything else in this world.  I felt unsafe that their was a potential of a riot to breakout around me at any second and I felt that I was trapped and couldn't go anywhere by my brother.
  </p>
  <p>What actions did you take to resolve your conflict?</p>
  <p class ="answers">
    I explained to my brother as to why I wanted to leave so promptly.  He didn't take this as well as I had hoped and still thought I was in the wrong.  I think it's hard for him to empathize with people that have a different set of values than him.
  </p>
  <p>If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</p>
  <p class ="answers">
    I would suggest that we go hangout somewhere in Baltimore where I felt safe.  He was hurt that I wanted to leave.  I should've told him let's go back to your apartment for a drink because I don't feel safe here given the recent riots in the city.
  </p>
  <p>What did you learn from this experience?</p>
  <p class ="answers">
    I learned that my actions can come off in a way that is very different than I intended.  I always try to be as nice and compassionate to everyone that I interact with, but I need to realize that I am acting how I view nice and compassionate.  I need to work on thinking about how people different than I am will view my actions.
