      Hearing Shereef talk about Dev Bootcamp got me even more excited to start the program.  In particular the learning analogy of Kitchen vs Table was really powerful.  It showed me that this is not going to be your typical learning experience where students follow a rigid curriculum where 90% of what we learn is not applicable to what they want to do. I believe that the learning environment in most places does not culture innovation and original thought.  After listening to this talk, it is clear that we are in charge of our own learning experience. I think I will strive in an environment as such, and can’t wait to start this experience with my cohort mates.

        My current impression of DBC is a 20 week program to develop people to their full potential by not only teaching them essential coding skills they need, but also developing them as a person and an extremely quick learner. This is very different than my impression a few weeks ago. I thought DBC was going to the best way to learn how to code in a team setting. Also this still remains true, I think DBC has a lot more to offer than just that. I couldn’t be more excited to continue the phase 0 prep work and get on site and work with my future colleagues.
