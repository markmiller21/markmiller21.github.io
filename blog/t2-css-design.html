  <h1>Margin, Border, and Padding Clarification</h1>

  <h4> Padding </h4>
  <section>
    <p>
      Padding is used to add white space around the area that you designate.  It helps to clear an area around content that seperated from other content.  Padding is the inner most shell in the Margin, Border, Margin sequence.  Padding can be applied uniformly with simple "padding: 10px;" notation, or can be specified in any direction (padding-bottom, padding-left, padding-right, padding-top).  Although typically used within the px & pt notation, padding can also be applied by %.

  <h4>Border</h4>
    <p>
        Outside of the padding shell lies the border.  As expected, the border function will apply a border that goes around both the content and the padding. There are many various of bordering including various colors, width, and types of lines.  Syntax for borders is slightly different.  Typical Syntax is "border: 10px dashed #0000ff;" where 10px is how thick the border is, dashed is the type of line, and #0000ff is the color.  Borders are probably the most used function of the three.
    </p>

  <h4>Margin</h4>
    <p>
        The outer most shell of the three is Margin.  Margin defines the area outside the border, but between other objects.  Margin is used most to gives a buffer better the content inside and proceeding content.  The margin can be set by length, percentage, inherit, and auto.
