  <h1>How to Use Array's and Hashes</h1>

        Arrays and hashes may seem identical on the surface, they are not in practice.  Both arrays and hashes are used to store information that can be accessed for later use, but the way they are stored are vastly different
    </p>
    <h4>
      Arrays
    </h4>
    <p>
      Array are stored a single series of data.  They can consist of number, strings, booleans statements, and anything else you can think of.  You can access any data point inside the array by calling its order in the array.  For example, if you had an array with 15 different email addresses and you wanted to get the 15th address in this array you would get it by typing in NAMEOFARRAY[14].

    <h4>
      Hashes
    </h4>
    <p>
      While an array is stored a series of data, Hashes store the data in ordered pairs.  Hashes work very similarly to arrays, except you access the data inside the hash differently than the array.  While you access data in array by refencing the position in the array, you access data in hashes by calling the refencing the key to get a value.  For example, hashes could be used to store email addresses.  The key would be the name of the person and the value would be the address.  So if you were to type EMAILHASH[mark] it would return my email address.  This is very useful because it allows you to organize data much easier.  Another use for hashes would be things like menu items & their prices, or bank accounts.  Hashes are extremely useful so it is important that we get accustomed with them.
