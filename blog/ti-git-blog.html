        One of the most useful features in Git is Version Control.  Version Control records saved versions of a file so that you can go back to any version at anytime you want.  You may be asking yourself, why would I want to go back to an older version of the code where my work isn't as sophiticated as my current. Well, imagine you are working on a project and you're adding finishing touches to teh code, and all of a sudden your current version won't even compile anymore.  Version Control allows the user to go back and checkout old verions of the code and compare them.  Thus helping the user debug the problem.

        The way that Git stores each version of the code is threw commits.  A commit is simply put, a copy of the code. Git (with the help of GitHub) allow you to keep different versions of the code organized in folders called branches.  You can create a "branch" of the master code at any time to work on.  The master code is rarely work on directly because the master version of the code is always intended on being fully functional.  We suggest that you work on branches to get all the kinks out of you code.  When we want to add the correct changes from the branch to a master we use the command line to merge and push the changes to our master

        As I mentioned above, Github is branches to stores each version of the code. This allows us to attempt new things without altering our working code. This may sound useful in an individual setting, but becomes even more useful when you apply it to a group project. Each coder can simply create a branch to work on so that we don't step on one-anothers toes.
