  <h4>What is Sterotype Threat?</h4>
  <p>If you are unfamilar with the term stereo-type threat, don't fear, I was too 24 hours ago but it is something that we encounter everyday and probably will encounter everyday for the rest of our lives. Claudia Steele defines Stereotype Threat the following way, "Stereotype threat refers to being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group." In laymans terms, stereotype threat is personally enforcing sterotypes that you belong to, onto yourself.  For example, if your a female that realizes that females generally underperform on quantitative tests like the GRE Math section, and you go into the GRE with this knowledge and simply accept it. Chances are you are going to underperform, despite having adequate acknowledge of said material.  Academics is certainly not the only field vulnerable to stereotype.</p>

  <h4>How have I experienced Stereotype Threat in my life-time?</h4>
  <p>Considering that I come from a rather priviledged back-ground (moderately well-off, Large White Male) I did encounter Stereotype Threat as much as others would.  The realm I experienced stereotype in most readily was most certainly the basketball court.  The majority of my childhood was spent with a basketball in my hand. Being white is generally seen as an advantage in this day and age, but certainly not on the basketball court.  The stereotype is that white guys are unathletic and don't put in the neccesary work to make it to the next level.  There are even multiple movies depicting these very stereotypes.  I would often times get ridiculed for this on the court.  It was a self-fullfilling profacy.  I did not end up making it to the collegete level, despite my skill, knowledge of the game, and physical gifts.  Looking back, if I had started lifting weights and training the way I should've been, I could be playing D1 basketball at most schools right now, but instead I chalked it up to the color of my skin.</p>
