  Very few people would argue that Cyber Security is not going to be one of the largest industries in our lifetime.  Technology has already made a huge impact in our society over the last twenty years.  The growth of these technologies are not going to slow anytime soon.  Tasks that would take would take days just twenty years ago, can now be accomplished at a fraction of the costs instantenously.  As our society continues to embrace technology, more vital information is being stored on cloud servers, mobile devices, and computers.  This information is not only worth a lot of money to the user, but is worth almost more to hackers.  The information I'm referring to could range from personal credit card numbers, social security numbers, inside information for corporations, to classified government information.  If these things get into the wrong hands, bad things will come of it.

<p>
  For this reason, Cyber Security will become one of the largest industries in our lifetime.  Cyber Security is currently a $97 billion dollar industry, and has grown by over $30 billion in the last 5 years.  Many analysts believe that we will continue to see atleast a 11% CAGR threw 2017.  To put this in to perspect, see the chart below
