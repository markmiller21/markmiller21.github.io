  <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>

  <h3><a href="#">Brief Introduction</a></h3>
    <p>My name is Mark Miller and I am an aspring coder.  I recently graduated from James Madison University and currently am working remotely as a student at Dev Bootcamp.  I will be moving up to NYC on July 24th to start the onsite poriton of DBC.  This is a preview of my website/ blog.  Feel free to click around and give me any suggestions about how I could improve it the site and what I could add.  Below is a little bit more about me if you're interested. </p>

  <h3><a href="https://www.jmu.edu/academics/undergraduate/majors/Quantitative%20Finance.shtml">James Madison University</a></h3>
    <p>I recently graduated from James Madison University where I majored in Quantitative Finace with minors in Economics and Mathematics.  Links for some of my more notable work at JMU are located in the Finance Portfolio & Other Projects tabs. </p>

  <h3><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/jmumif2/home">Madison Investment Fund</a></h3>
    <p>Outside of my studies I spent the majority of my time doing research and work for the Madison Investment Fund (MIF). MIF is a student led investment fund that manages a portion of JMU's endownment in the stock market.  I was the Portfolio Manager of the Technology Sector my senior year, while holding a number of roles throughout the rest of my collegiate career.  As the manager of the Technology Sector I decided to pitch Amazon Corp (AMZN) to the fund in the Spring of 2015.  A copy of this pitch can be found in the Finance Portfolio tab. </p>
